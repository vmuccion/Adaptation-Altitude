# Adaptation-Altitude
Notebooks and data files for the Adaptation at Altitude manuscript. The notebook EDA_Solutions_Basic_Experimental_2.ipynb analyses the general characteristics of the adaptation solutions. The notebook EDA_Solutions_OneHot-October2023.ipynb contains more sophisticated exploratory data analysis (EDA). For example, the notebook allows to derive the Pearson correlation amongstdifferent entries in the dataset of adaptation solutions. It is also used to produce a coropleth map to derive the geographical distribution of adaptation solutions and many other features. The notebook SolutionPortal_TextAnalysis is used for simple semantic anaysis, such as generating a word clouds. Accompayining the notebooks are two dataset:1) an excel file SolutionDatabase.xlsx which is the main dataset used for most of the analysis; 2) Data_Transformation.xlsx which is used for the analysis of the transformative potantial.
