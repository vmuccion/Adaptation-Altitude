# Adaptation-Altitude
Notebooks and data files for the Adaptation at Altitude manuscript. The notebook ##EDA_Solutions_Basic_Experimental_2.ipynb analyse the general characteristics of the database, such assolution per impacts, ecosystem types, soluion types and sector types. It also lists the ex post benefits of solutions. Visualisation techiniques used are bar charts with matplotlib.  The notebook EDA_Solutions_OneHot-October2023.ipynb contains more sophisticated exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the Adaptation at Altitude solution portal. For example, the notebook allows to derive the Pearson correlation amongst meaningful entries in the database. It is used to produce a coropleth map of the coutnries distribution and other features. The notebook SolutionPortal_TextAnalysis is mainly for simple semantic anaysis, such as word clouds.
